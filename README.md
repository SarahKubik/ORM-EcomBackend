# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) - Ecommerce Backend Database

## User Story

>A fully integrated backend database for an e-commerce site.

## User Acceptance

>Illustrating Object-Relational Mapping by delivering a secured functional Express.js API using MySql workbench and Sequelize.

## Database Architecture

<ul>
<li>Secured variable to store sensitive data:
<ul>
 <li>Password</li>
 <li>Username</li>
 <li>Host</li>
</ul>
<li>Server start functionality</li>
<li>Sequelize Models</li>
<li>Routes</li>
<li>Seed commands </li>
<li>Schema setup</li>
<li>MySQL integration </li>
</ul>

## Tested - CRUD Operations

>Using **Insomnia API Client and Design Tool**, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations were used to call database routes to test functionality.
>>Testing proved that the POST, PUT, and DELETE routes  create, update, and delete the data in the database.The
GET routes delivered categories, products and or tag attributes.The results were displayed in JSON.
